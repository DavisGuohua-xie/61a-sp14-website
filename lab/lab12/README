Setting up the Lab
==================

To start Hadoop, go on the master account and source the file `envvars`
from the lab. Then run

    ~/projects/hadoop/hadoop/bin/start-all.sh

This starts all the relevant nodes for Hadoop. Students should now be
able to run Hadoop jobs. At this point, you should run the linecount
example from the Part 2 of the lab to verify that it works. If there
are any difficulties, contact Inst.

The lab makes use of `shakespeare.txt` and `sentiments.csv`. You will
need to upload this file onto the Hadoop FileSystem:

    hadoop dfs -put ~cs61a/lib/shakespeare.txt ../shakespeare.txt
    hadoop dfs -put ~cs61a/lib/sentiments.csv ../sentiments.csv

(It appears that the filesystem is cleared periodically.)

To turn off the clusters, run the following from the master account

    ~/projects/hadoop/hadoop/bin/stop-all.sh
