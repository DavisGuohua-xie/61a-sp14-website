    <h3>The Game of Hog</h3>
    <div id="content">
      <div id="scoreboard"> Current score:
        <span class="points" id="score">0</span> to

        <p>
          In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to reach 100 points first.
          On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll,
          up to 10. Her turn score is the sum of the dice outcomes, unless any
          of the dice come up a 1 (<span class="rule" id="out">Pig out</span>),
          in which case the score for her turn is only 1 point.
        </p>

        <p>
          To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b><span class="rule" id="bacon">Free bacon</span></b>. If a player
            chooses to roll zero dice, she scores one more than the largest
            digit in her opponent's score. For example, if Player 1 has 42
            points, Player 0 gains 1 + max(4, 2) = 5 points by rolling zero
            dice.  If Player 1 has 48 points, Player 0 gains 1 + max(4, 8) = 9
            points.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><span class="rule" id="wild">Hog wild</span></b>. If the sum of
            both players' total scores is a multiple of seven (e.g., 14, 21,
            35), then the current player rolls four-sided dice instead of the
            usual six-sided dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><span class="rule" id="swine">Swine swap</span></b>. If at the
            end of a turn one of the player's total score is exactly double the
            other's, then the players swap total scores.

            <i>Example 1:</i> Player 0 has 20 points and Player 1 has 5; it is
            Player 1's turn. She scores 5 more, bringing her total to 10. The
            players swap scores: Player 0 now has 10 points and Player 1 has
            20. It is now Player 0's turn.

            <i>Example 2</i>: Player 0 has 90 points and Player 1 has 50; it is
            Player 0's turn.  She scores 10 more, bringing her total to 100.
            The players swap scores, and Player 1 wins the game 100 to 50.
