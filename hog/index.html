    <h3>The Game of Hog</h3>

        <span class="points" id="score">0</span> to

        <p>
          In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to reach 100 points first.
          On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll,
          up to 10. Her turn score is the sum of the dice outcomes, unless any
          of the dice come up a 1 (<span class="rule" id="out">Pig out</span>),
          in which case the score for her turn is only 1 point.
        </p>

        <p>
          To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b><span class="rule" id="wild">Hog Wild</span></b>. If the sum of
            both players' total scores is a multiple of 7 (e.g., 14, 21, 35),
            then the current player rolls 4-sided dice instead of the usual
            6-sided dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><span class="rule" id="bacon">Free Bacon</span></b>. If a player
            chooses to roll zero dice, she scores one more than the sum of the
            digits of her opponent's score. E.g., if player 1 has 42 points,
            player 0 can earn 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 points by rolling zero dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><span class="rule" id="ham">Holiday Ham</span></b>. If a player's
            score for the turn is a prime number, then instead she scores 5
            times the number of dice rolled. (Note: 1 is not prime, but 2 is.)
            This modification does not apply to points earned from Free Bacon.
