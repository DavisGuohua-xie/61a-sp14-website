  <h2>Project 1 Revisions</h2>

  <p>You may revise your <a href="hog/hog.html">project 1</a> submission in
  order to earn back any composition points (the three points assigned by
  readers) you lost on your original submission.  You cannot earn back
  correctness points. To do so, make changes to your original submission that
  address the suggestions made by your reader.

  <p>Send us your revision of hog.py by typing <code>submit proj1revision</code>
  to submit your revised <code>hog.py</code> file. If you have questions for
  your reader, you can respond to your reader's comments using the
  <a href="http://ucb-codereview.appspot.com/fa13/">composition feedback site</a>.

  <p>Revisions are due on Thursday, 11/7 at 11:59 pm.
